You're using Typescript, Hono, Drizzle ORM, and OpenAI with Node.js.

<project_rules>
- Always write the entire code and stay motivated to write it to the letter
- Write functional and declarative code and patterns related to it
- Use Typescript for all the code. Prefer interfaces over types.
- Always follow the style of the code you're editing
- Avoid using classes, prefer functional approach
- Use descriptive variable names such as `user_name` instead of `name`
- Use descriptive function names such as `setInteractionState` instead of `updateInteraction`
- Fail early (exit function early) when possible and take care of error handling
- Use `uuid` for unique identifiers
- The latest OpenAI model is `gpt-4o` not `gpt-4`
- The latest Node.js version we're using is `20.x` and it supports natively async/await, promises and fetch api
- Use Zod for runtime validation and error handling.
- Use `uuidv4` for generating UUIDs
